Problem #1

When Android client cannot receive push
it recieve a message

Connection closed with error
org.jivesoftware.smack.SmackException: Parser got END_DOCUMENT event. 
This could happen e.g. 
if the server closed the connection without sending a closing stream element

When we put errors output Android application fall down

Problem #2 
If we have unset() in 538,558,576 IOS application work perfectly,
But Android application didnt recieve XMPP not GCM,
but when I send request by postman IOS crashes


Problem#2 Case 2

Android application work not stable with Push XMPP not with GCM
But I think this is because of This kind of XMPP

When we comment unset() in 538,558,576

IOS application receive 3 times Ride request,
But Android application receive Ride request only in tray.


And one question about tokens.
Do we need to accept token to each API and is it depends with sessions?
I didnt find such dependency.
But I think Indians develope in application such possibility


private function pp($var, $die = false) {
    echo '<pre>';
    print_r($var);
    if($die)
    die;
    echo '</pre>';
}
$this->pp($idss, 1);
